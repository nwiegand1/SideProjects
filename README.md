Repository for Women in Computer Science (WiCS) Side Projects project by Dagmawit and Natalie

Our ideas:

* eating disorder treatment finder
* scheduling app
* Medical Decision-Making Statistics tool (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Gc35HBImxg9Lyu8VDytgG-tUABU19yzfbu9HkNHt1Q/edit)
* simple app that takes restaurant utensil buyers to buy environmentally friendly options and see how much they help the environment
* crowd funding platform to fund solar installations in specific segments. For example, K-12 schools in economically disadvantaged regions
* Renewable energy enrollment: app for CCA customers to review energy bill and opt up to renewable energy from their phones rather than calling the 800 number or going on line
* use the ISO Today app to help users coordinate charging of EVs to a certain point
